### **Explanation of Key Directories and Files**:

#### **Backend (`/backend`)**:
1. **`controllers/`**:
   - **`authController.js`**: Handles user registration, login, and JWT token generation.
   - **`taskController.js`**: Handles CRUD operations for tasks, task assignment, completion, and verification by admins.
  
2. **`middleware/`**:
   - **`authMiddleware.js`**: Middleware for JWT verification to protect routes, and checking admin permissions.

3. **`models/`**:
   - **`User.js`**: Mongoose schema for users, including name, email, password, phone (SMS), account balance (points), and admin role.
   - **`Task.js`**: Mongoose schema for tasks, including task details, point value, assignment, and completion/verification status.

4. **`routes/`**:
   - **`authRoutes.js`**: Routes for user registration and login.
   - **`taskRoutes.js`**: Routes for CRUD operations (admin) and task completion (non-admin).

5. **`nodemailer.js`**: (Optional) Handles sending email notifications when tasks are completed (can be used in `taskController`).

6. **`.env`**: Environment variables (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`, `MONGO_URI`).

7. **`server.js`**:
   - Entry point of the Express server.
   - Sets up routes and middleware.
   - Connects to the MongoDB database.

---

#### **Frontend (`/frontend`)** [If Applicable]:
1. **`components/`**:
   - **`AdminDashboard.js`**: Admin view for managing tasks and users.
   - **`TaskList.js`**: Non-admin view of tasks available to the user for completion.
  
2. **`pages/`**:
   - **`Login.js`**: Page for logging in with email and password.
   - **`Register.js`**: Page for signing up as a new user.
   - **`TaskDetails.js`**: Page where a user can view, check out, and complete tasks.

3. **`App.js`**:
   - Main component that manages routes and renders different components based on user roles (admin vs non-admin).

---

### **Key Features**:
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can register and log in, receiving a JWT token for authentication.
   - JWT is used to protect routes and check admin permissions.

2. **Task Management**:
   - **Admins** can create, update, delete, and verify tasks.
   - **Non-admins (residents)** can sign up for tasks, complete them, and receive points once the admin verifies completion.

3. **Notifications**:
   - Email or SMS notifications can be triggered to alert the admin when a task is marked as complete (handled via **Nodemailer** or **Twilio**).

4. **Protected Routes**:
   - Tasks and user management routes are protected using the JWT-based `authenticateToken` middleware and the `authenticateAdmin` middleware for admin-only access.

---

### **Final Notes**:

- The backend is structured with separate concerns for **user management**, **task management**, and **authentication**.
- The frontend structure can be enhanced based on the complexity of the user interface, but this structure provides a good starting point for admin dashboards and resident task management.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or specific code implementations for any part of this project! ðŸ’»ðŸ‘¾
